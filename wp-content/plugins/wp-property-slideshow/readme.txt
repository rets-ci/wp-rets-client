== Description ==

The Slideshow Add-on allows you to insert a slideshow into any property page, home page, or virtually anywhere in your blog.

We made it extremely simple - the slideshow page searches through the Media Library looking for images that are big enough for the slideshow - dimensions to which you would specify in the main WP-Property control panel.

== Changelog ==

= 4.0.0 =
* Warnings fixes.
* Moved feature to separate plugin.

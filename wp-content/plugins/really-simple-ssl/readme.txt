No setup required! You only need an SSL certificate, and this plugin will do the rest.

== Description ==
The really simple ssl plugin detects ssl by trying to open a page through https.
If ssl is detected it will configure your site to support ssl.

= Two simple steps for setup: =
* Get an SSL certificate from your hosting provider (can't do that for you, sorry).
* Activate this plugin.

= Love Really Simple SSL? =
I’ve invested hundreds of hours in the development of this plugin, which hopefully saved you at least some hours work. If you want to support the continuing development of this plugin, I’d really appreciate it if you buy me a cup of coffee.
[To the coffeecorner ;)](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=ZEQHXWTSQVAZJ&lc=NL&item_name=rogierlankhorst%2ecom&item_number=really%2dsimple%2dssl%2dplugin&currency_code=EUR&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donateCC_LG%2egif%3aNonHosted)

= What does the plugin actually do =
* The plugin handles most issues that Wordpress has with ssl, like the much discussed loadbalancer issue, or when there are no server variables set at all.
* All incoming requests are redirected to https. If possible with .htaccess, or else with javascript.
* The site url and home url are changed to https.
* Your insecure content is fixed by replacing all http:// urls with the protocol-independent //. Dynamically, so no database changes are made (except for the siteurl and homeurl).

= Feedback is welcome! =
Though the plugin is extensively tested and currently successfully active on over 8000 websites, it is impossible to test or even conceive of every different server configuration. So it might be possible you have issues with a non-standard server configuration.
I would appreciate it if you contact me with the issue, so I can help you fix it and improve the plugin at the same time.
I will need the following information:

* Debug report: activate debug and copy the results
* Domain

[contact](https://www.really-simple-ssl.com/contact/) me if you have any questions, issues, or suggestions. More information about me or my work can be found on my [website](https://www.rogierlankhorst.com).

= Like to have this plugin in your language? =
Translations can be added very easily [here](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/really-simple-ssl).

= Translation credits =
Thanks for the French translation to [Cédric](http://www.blig.fr/)
Thanks for the Russian translation to [xsacha](https://news36.org/)

= Under development, expected early 2016 =
* A check for possible external resources that are not available over ssl.

== Installation ==
To install this plugin:

1. Install your ssl certificate
2. Download the plugin
3. Upload the plugin to the wp-content/plugins directory,
4. Go to “plugins” in your wordpress admin, then click activate.
5. You will get redirected to the login screen. If not, go to the login screen and log on.

= Testing =
This plugin is tested in standard apache environments, but is built with several fallbacks for situations where non-standard configurations are used.
If you have issues, please contact me. Maybe we can fix your configuration as well.

= Uninstalling =
In some cases it happens that you cannot access your admin anymore, which would prevent your from uninstalling. The
plugin is shipped with a simple method to uninstall:

1. In the wp-content/plugins/really-simple-ssl folder, rename the file "force-deactivate.txt" to "force-deactivate.php".
2. In your browser, go to www.yourdomain.com/wp-content/plugins/really-simple-ssl/force-deactivate.php (replace yourdomain.com with your own domain).

The plugin is now deactivated and all changes were removed.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Knowledge base =
For more detailed explanations and documentation, please search the [documentation](http://www.really-simple-ssl.com/knowledge-base/)

= Does the mixed content fixer make my site slower? =
On a site where the source consists of about 60.000 characters, the delay caused by the mixed content fixer is about 0.00188 seconds. If this is too much for you, fix the mixed content manuallya and deactivate it in the settings.

= Mixed content issues =
Most mixed content issues are caused by urls in css or js files.
For detailed instructions on how to find mixed content read this [article](https://really-simple-ssl.com/knowledge-base/how-to-track-down-mixed-content-or-insecure-content/).

= Redirect loop issues =
* If you are experiencing redirect loops on your site, you might want to try disabling the .htaccess:

1. Remove this plugins's rules from your .htaccess.
2. Add to your wp-config.php:
define( 'RLRSSSL_DO_NOT_EDIT_HTACCESS', TRUE);

= Parts of my site aren’t loading =
* If parts of your site aren't loading, you might have external resources that are not able to load on ssl. Check the Google console.

= How to uninstall when website/backend is not accessible =
Though this plugin is extensively tested, this can still happen. However, this is very easy to fix (you'll need ftp access):

1. In the wp-content/plugins/really-simple-ssl folder, rename the file "force-deactivate.txt" to "force-deactivate.php".
2. In your browser, go to www.yourdomain.com/wp-content/plugins/really-simple-ssl/force-deactivate.php (replace yourdomain.com with your own domain).

The plugin is now deactivated and all changes were removed.

= What does the option "HSTS" mean? =
HSTS means HTTP Strict Transport Security, and makes browsers force your visitors over https.
As this setting will be remembered by your visitor's browsers for at least a year, you should only enable this when your setup is up and running, and you do not plan
to revert back to http.

= My hits in Google Analytics have dropped. What happened? =
After you move to SSL, you should change your domain in Google Analytics as well. In Google Search Console, you should add the https variant.
If the redirect wasn't set in your .htaccess for some reason, try to add it manually. I've had feedback that GA does not register hits when the redirect was not in place.

= The settings page says redirect could not be set in the .htaccess. Is that a problem? =
Not really. The plugin also adds some javascript to redirect any non https pages, so your site should load over https without any problems.
Furthermore, you can enable the HSTS setting to improve security.

Common causes:
1. The .htaccess is not writable, or not available. To fix it, make writable, or enter the rewriterules manually
2. Testing of the .htaccess rewrite rules failed, due to missing server variables or not being able to reach the testing page. These issues are caused by your server configuration, contact your hosting provider

= Is it possible to exclude certain urls from the ssl redirect? =
That is not possible. This plugin simply forces your complete site over https, which keeps it lightweight.

= Is the plugin suitable for wordpress multisite? =
Yes, the plugin is wpmu ready.
You can activate ssl per site on subdomain and domain mapping installs. On subfolder installs networkwide activation is encouraged (domain.com/site1).

= Does the plugin do a seo friendly 301 redirect in the .htaccess? =
Yes, default the plugin redirects permanently with [R=301].

== Changelog ==
= 2.2.12 =
* To prevent lockouts, it is no longer possible to activate plugin when wp-config.php is not writable. In case of loadbalancers, activating ssl without adding the necessary fix in the wp-config would cause a redirect loop which would lock you out of the admin.

== Upgrade notice ==
Always back up before any upgrade. Especially .htaccess, wp-config.php and the plugin folder. This way you can easily roll back.
In general I would always recommend a solid backup policy, as that will prevent a lot of stress, yelling, and hitting yourself.

== Screenshots ==
1. After activation, your ssl will be detected if present
2. View your configuration on the settings page
3. Check if your site has mixed content. If you want you can just leave it that way, because of the built in mixed content fixer.
